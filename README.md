# Kanban4U
Help organize what you have to do with a Kanban style organizer.

### What will the application do?
 * Allow you to add different types of tasks (errands, assignments, test)
 * Allows you to stage different tasks that you have 

### Who will use it?
Hopefully University students, especially first years. I found that my schedule was very busy and my favourite way to
organize everything was to use a Kanban organizational system. I know I definitely will use it.

### Why is this project of interest to you?
As much I enjoy using Trello to organize myself, I feel like there are certain features lacking, particularly when
dealing with different courses and errands. Something like an essay may need several stages like to do, in progress, 
and review. Whereas something like buying groceries will only have two states: to do and done. Exams also cannot be
completed in advance, they can only be done on a specific date.
